I used this 12 300VA transformer, which I sligtly modified. The secondary winding consisted of 4 wires connected in parallel. I split them in 2 and connected in series, getting 24V with a center tap). Last but not least I added another winding of around 8V.

I used an old graphics card's heatsink for cooling.

It was based on SN1534 power supply, its schematics can be found there as well.
